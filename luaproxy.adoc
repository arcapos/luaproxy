Creating And Accessing Lua States
---------------------------------

The proxy modules allows for new Lua states to be created from an
existing Lua state and to access data in the other Lua state. Once a
proxy object has been created, it can be accessed like a regular Lua
table to set and get variable from the proxied state.
